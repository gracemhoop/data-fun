FinanceAnalysis.ipynb: Analysis done in 2024 for Chico Green City Coalition for Chico's city council elections. The information used to determine this is publicly available. This analysis was used to determine:
1. Who is funding the candidates?
    - What are the top donor industries (e.g., real estate, construction, unions, tech, advocacy groups)?
How much funding comes from local vs. out-of-town donors?
Are there any large individual contributors who may have significant influence?
2. Are there any potential conflicts of interest?
Are candidates receiving large donations from companies or individuals that have pending business with the city (e.g., developers, contractors, lobbyists)?
Does the candidateâ€™s policy platform align with the interests of their major donors?
Are donations concentrated in specific industries, signaling potential favoritism?
3. How does money impact competitiveness?
Which candidates have the largest war chests and can afford more outreach (ads, events, staffing)?
Is there a correlation between fundraising and polling numbers?
Do grassroots candidates with small donations stand a competitive chance?
4. How are campaign funds being spent?
What percentage of donations go toward advertising, staffing, consultants, or events?
Are there any unusual expenses or signs of misuse of funds?
How efficient is each campaign in converting dollars into voter outreach?
5. Is there a difference in funding between incumbents and challengers?
Do incumbents receive more institutional and PAC money compared to challengers?
Are first-time candidates relying more on small-dollar donations?
Does money from prior campaigns give incumbents a major advantage?
6. What trends exist over time?
Has campaign spending increased over election cycles?
Are there shifts in donor priorities (e.g., rise of environmental PACs, more small-dollar grassroots donations)?
Is one political party or ideology consistently raising more in city elections?
7. How do campaign donations correlate with election results?
Do candidates who raise the most money typically win?
Are there exceptions where a low-funded candidate won, signaling high voter engagement despite low spending?
Does the source of funding impact election success (e.g., small grassroots vs. large corporate donations)?
Real-World Applications:
A financial analysis can provide journalists, watchdog groups, voters, and policymakers with insights into the role of money in local politics. If certain candidates heavily rely on specific industries, it can raise questions about future policy decisions and potential biases.
